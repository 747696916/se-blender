{"name":"SE Block Tools","tagline":"a Blender addon that helps modeling and exporting blocks for Space Engineers","body":"# About\r\n\r\nModeling blocks for Space Engineers is a process that involves a lot of intermediary files and manual parametrization.\r\nThis addon eases the steps you need to take to get from a 3D mesh in Blender to Space Engineer's own .mwm mesh-format.\r\nTo do that it provides property panels for all the special data Space Engineers stores inside an .mwm file\r\ndirectly in Blender.\r\nIn addition it is able to automatically configure and run the conversion-tools you would normally run by hand.\r\n\r\nThe addon (and this documentation) expect you to know how to work with Blender.\r\nSo if you are new to 3D modeling you should probably learn how to do that properly before you continue.\r\n\r\nTODO Having said that, there is an adendum that should help you to get on the right track.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
