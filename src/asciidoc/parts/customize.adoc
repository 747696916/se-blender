The add-on uses a custom Blender node-tree to drive the export.
The connections between the nodes of that tree describe how the objects in the scene flow through the export.

The sockets of the nodes are color-coded to quickly recognized which sockets can connect to each other.
The color-coding also signals if the connection between two nodes is dysfunctional by turning the sockets dark-grey.
This happens if the nodes detect that no objects would flow between them -- most probably because there _are_ no objects.
If an illegal connection is detected the affected sockets will be colored bright red.

=== Text Nodes and Sockets

image::nodes-text.png[width=550,align=center,link=images/nodes-text.png]

Several of the other nodes require text-input to name the files they produce.
You can provide that text either directly via the corresponding white input-socket of each node or,
if you want to reuse a text snippet, you can instead use a text-node and connect that to the input-socket.
To avoid having to define an export node-tree for each scene all text-fields can use parameters that
get substituted with information stored in the scene:

[cols="2,4"]
|===
| Parameter Name | Description

| `BlockPairName`
| Contains the name of the scene. The suffixes `.001`, `.Large` and `.Small` are automatically removed.

| `SubtypeId`
| Normally derived from the scene-name and the cube-size but can be explicitly configured in the scene properties.

| `CubeSize`
| Either `Large` or `Small` depending on the configured cube-size. Will contain both values consecutively
  if the scene is configured to automatically create a scaled-down small version.

| `n`
| The sequence-number of the source-socket. See the next section for details.

=== Object Sources

This kind of nodes determines meshes and empties that get exported. There are two variants.

. The first variant uses a layer mask to combine all meshes and empties from the marked layers and
  provides them under a single output-socket for consumption by other nodes.
. The second variant also uses a layer mask but provides a separate output-socket for each layer.
  This is useful for a sequential groups of meshes like construction stages.
  This variant also implicitly numbers the output-sockets starting at `1`.
  This number is available for text-substitution as parameter `${n}`.

=== Havok Converter

This kind of node produces a `.hkt` file by taking the objects from its input-socket and running them
first through Havok's FBX Importer and after that through Havok's Standalone Filter Manager.

NOTE: The node ignores objects that don't have `Rigid Body` enabled on their `Physics` property-tab.

image::nodes-mwm.png[width=150,float=right,link=images/nodes-mwm.png]

=== MwmBuilder

This kind of node produces a `.mwm` file by taking the objects from its input-socket and running
them through MwmBuilder.
The `.mwm` will include the collision data of a Havok Converter node if it is connected to one.
An MwmBuilder node can also receive the output of other MwmBuilder nodes.
Those nodes will then provide the link:#levels-of-detail[level-of-detail] models that will be linked to
from the `.mwm` file produced by the current node.

image::nodes-blockdef.png[width=150,float=right,link=images/nodes-blockdef.png]

=== Block Definition

An export-tree can only contain a single node of this kind.
The node takes the output from several other nodes to generate the link:#block-definitions[block-definition] for the scene.
Of special note are the input-sockets for link:#mount-points[mount-points] and link:#mirroring[mirroring-settings]
which are not consumed anywhere else in the export-tree.

NOTE: Updating CubeBlocks.sbc will be disabled if the export-tree contains no node of this kind.
