== Installation

=== Getting the tools

The first thing you need to do to get started is to download and install all the required parts.

Blender::
Get version http://www.blender.org/download/[2.72 or later] (90MB), 2.73 is current at the time of this writing.

The Havok "Content Tools for Game Artists and Designers"::
Get version https://software.intel.com/sites/havok/en/[2013.1.0]
(https://software.intel.com/sites/havok/downloads/HavokContentTools_2013-1-0_20130717_64Bit_PcXs.exe[64bit]
or https://software.intel.com/sites/havok/downloads/HavokContentTools_2013-1-0_20130717_32Bit_PcXs.exe[32bit], 330MB)
This contains the filter manager `hctStandAloneFilterManager.exe` that's used to create rigid-body physics data.
The default install location is `C:\Program Files\Havok\HavokContentTools`

WARNING: You need to get Havok 2013.1. Space Engineers is currently unable to use files created with Havok 2014.

The Havok FBX Importer::
This is a https://github.com/harag-on-steam/fbximporter/releases/tag/havok2013.1-fbx2015.1[separate download] (3,5MB)
because I had to https://github.com/harag-on-steam/fbximporter/compare/abb0b1aebb842b43220525ca40ef62af4653589b...master[fix a view things]
in the sources and compile it against Havok 2013.1
(the http://www.projectanarchy.com/download[official download] is compiled against Havok 2014).
The .zip contains just one executable file. It's probably a good idea to put it into the Havok Tools directory.

MwmBuilder::
This one comes with Space Engineers and is located in the game's directory under `Tools\MwmBuilder`.

=== Installing the Addon

Once you got the https://github.com/harag-on-steam/se-blender/releases/latest[current version] (30kb)
install it in Blender like any other third-party addon by going to the user preferences,
switch to the "Add-Ons" tab,
click on "Install from File..." and
point Blender to the downloaded .zip.

Like any addon you need to enable it after you've installed it.
You can find the addon by using the search box or going to the Category "Space Engineers".
After you've enabled the addon open its settings by clicking the arrow on the left.
You need to provide all the paths in the list.

IMPORTANT: Use the "workaround" option for MwmBuilder only if that specific bug is still present.
You can get more information by opening the bug-thread with the button next to the option.

TIP: Don't forget to "Save User Settings".
