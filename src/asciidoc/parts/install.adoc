=== Getting the tools

To get started first you need to download and install all the required tools.

Blender::
Get version {dl} http://www.blender.org/download/[2.72 or later] (90MB), 2.74 is current at the time of this writing.

The Havok "Content Tools for Game Artists and Designers"::
Get version {dl} https://software.intel.com/sites/havok/en/[2013.1.0]
(https://software.intel.com/sites/havok/downloads/HavokContentTools_2013-1-0_20130717_64Bit_PcXs.exe[64bit]
or https://software.intel.com/sites/havok/downloads/HavokContentTools_2013-1-0_20130717_32Bit_PcXs.exe[32bit], 330MB)
This contains the filter manager `hctStandAloneFilterManager.exe` that's used to create rigid-body physics data.
The default install location is `C:\Program Files\Havok\HavokContentTools`

WARNING: You need to get Havok 2013.1. Space Engineers is currently unable to use files created with Havok 2014.

The Havok FBX Importer::
This is a {dl} https://github.com/harag-on-steam/fbximporter/releases/tag/havok2013.1-fbx2015.1[separate download] (3,5MB)
because I had to https://github.com/harag-on-steam/fbximporter/compare/abb0b1aebb842b43220525ca40ef62af4653589b%E2%80%A67ae7b96a8ef1bf9f0f4b643c16198afb89b67656[fix a view things]
in the sources and compile it against Havok 2013.1
(the http://www.projectanarchy.com/download[official download] is compiled against Havok 2014).
The .zip contains just one executable file. It's probably a good idea to put it into the Havok Tools directory.

MwmBuilder::
This one comes with Space Engineers and is located in the game's directory under `Tools\MwmBuilder`.

NOTE: If you try to export and MwmBuilder fails with the error message
`"Error loading unmanaged library from path: Assimp32.dll"`
this is a strong indication that you are missing a software library on your system.
You can {dl} https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679[download that] from Microsoft.
Get the `VSU_4\vcredist_x86.exe` package.

After you've enabled the add-on open its settings by clicking the arrow on the left.
