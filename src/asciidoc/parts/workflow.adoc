=== File layout

The add-on only has one mandatory requirement in regards to the folder layout:

IMPORTANT: The .blend file(s) must be in the base-folder of your mod.

This is necessary so that all relative paths (textures, models, etc.) are calculated correctly.

=== Scene Layout

The addon only provides its tools to scenes that are marked as containing a block. +
You do that on the Space Engineers Block panel of the Scene properties-tab.

Here you also find the settings that are relevant for the basic layout of the block:

* Is the block a large or a small block?
* Should the export automatically create a small version of your block if it is a large one?
* What is the dimension of you block in in-game grid-units?

The layers of the scene contain the different components of a block.
Below is the default layer-setup that is described in the following sections.

image::layer-overview.png[align=center,width=550,link=images/layer-overview.png]

==== Main Model

The first layer contains the model of the fully-built block.
You don't need to restrict yourself to only one mesh-object on this layer.
If it's useful to split your block into several objects -- probably to apply modifiers to some of them -- by all means do so.

==== Collision Model

image::blender-physics.png[width=450,float=right,link=images/blender-physics.png]

The second layer contains the simplified meshes that represent the block's collision shape.
If you don't provide any collision meshes the resulting .mwm file will not contain collision data
and SE will default to a simple collision box that encompasses the whole block.

Havok, the physics engine of SE, requires some settings to do its work.
You provide those on Blender's Physics tab by enabling `Rigid Bodies` for your collision meshes.
Only the settings `Shape`, `Mass`, `Friction` and `Bounciness` (Restitution) are exported to Havok.

Of those settings `Shape` is the most important because it has a significant performance impact.
Whenever possible try to only approximate the shape of your block.
Use primitive shapes like `Box` or `Cylinder`. Use `Convex Hull` only if necessary. Avoid `Mesh` collisions.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you
http://www.blender.org/manual/getting_started/basics/transformations/transform_control/reset_object_transformations.html#apply-options[apply object transformations]
to all collision objects before export.
As a rule of thumb the add-on never modifies your objects on its own so you have to do this yourself.
If you don't the collision shapes will most probably be rotated or positioned wrong.

WARNING: Keep in mind SE has a limit for the maximum number of collision shapes per block.

NOTE: Blender offers a `Cone` primitive shape but Havok has no support for that.
If you use a Cone shape it will be silently converted to a Convex Hull on export.

[#mount-points]
==== Mount Points

image::blender-mp-setup.png[width=450,float=right,link=images/blender-mp-setup.png]

The third layer defines the mount points of your block.
The meshes on this layer are not directly exported but are used instead to calculate the
link:#blockdef[mount point definitions] {zoom}.

This works by creating rectangular faces that use the material `MountPoint` and are aligned to one of
six sides of the block. To quickly create the material and an object that has one mount point face for each
of the six sides use the corresponding button on the Tools panel of the 3D view.
Duplicate, resize and move those faces in edit mode to create more mount points for a side of the block.
You can also split out faces to several objects if you want to apply
link:images/blender-mp-mirror.png[modifiers like 'mirror' or 'array'] {zoom}
to some of the mount point faces.

For mount point editing it is a good idea to switch to link:images/blender-mp-ortho.png[ortho-view] {zoom} (`Numpad 5`) and
turn on 'snap to grid'.
You can also tell the add-on to show the block's bounding box by enabling the option on the
link:images/blender-scene.png[scene tab] {zoom}.
It's dashed, orange lines represent the space your block occupies in-game.
This should help you to position the mount points correctly.

If you don't provide mount points none will be calculated.
The game defaults to full mount points on all sides of the block in that case.

==== Construction Stages

Layers 11-13 are used for the construction stages of the block.
There is one layer for each stage of construction, from earliest to latest.
If you change the number of construction layers you increase or decrease the number of construction stages.
A block is allowed to have no construction stages at all.

NOTE: If you don't have meshes on a construction layer it will be skipped and your block will have one stage less.

By default the construction stages reuse the same collision shape your main block model uses.
It's possible to change that using different export settings.
But keep in mind that can be dangerous to a ship or the player
if a block changes its physical dimensions when it is welded to completion.

TIP: A Blender mesh-object can be assigned to several layers.
So if your construction models get more and more detailed you can start with the basic shape as one object that
is visible on all construction layers and then progressively add more objects towards the final construction layer.

==== Levels of Detail

Layers 6-8 are used to model versions of your main model that have progressively less detail.
The game can display those models when the block is too far away to see the small details of your main model.
This way less triangles need to be rendered which is good for performance.
The default distances at which the models are switched are 10, 30 and 50.

NOTE: If you don't have meshes on a LOD layer it will not be included in the export and
the game will not switch models at that distance.
