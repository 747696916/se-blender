== Using the addon

=== File layout

The addon makes a few assumptions about filenames and the folder layout of your mod:

* The .blend file(s) are assumed to be at the root of your mod folder.
* Models are in a subfolder `Models\`. They are not sorted into further subfolders.
* Icons are in `Textures\Icons\`.

NOTE: This layout currently cannot be changed.

=== Scene Layout

Inside Blender the addon uses one scene per block.
That's why the block-settings are on the scene tab of the properties-panel.

On this panel you define if the block is a large or a small block and if the export should automatically
create a small version of your block if it is a large one.
You also define the size of your block in in-game grid units here.

The layers of the scene contain the different components of a block.
If you don't like the default layout you can change it with the corresponding layer masks on the scene panel.

==== Main Layer

By default you have one layer that contains the model of the fully-built block.
You don't need to restrict yourself to only one mesh object.
If it's useful to split your block into several objects (probably to apply modifiers to some parts) by all means do so.

==== Collision Layer

[.thumb]
image::blender-physics.png[width=450,float=right,link=images/blender-physics.png]

Next you have a layer that contains the simplified meshes that represent the block's collision shape.
If you don't provide any collision meshes or unmark the layer the resulting .mwm file
will not contain collision data and SE will default to a simple collision box that encompasses the whole block.

Havok, the physics engine of SE, requires some settings do its work.
You provide those on Blender's Physics tab by enabling Rigid Bodies for your collision meshes.
Only the settings `Shape`, `Mass`, `Friction` and `Bounciness` (Restitution) are exported to Havok.
Of those `Shape` is the most important because it has a significant performance impact.
Whenever possible try to only approximate the shape of your block.
Use primitive shapes like `Box` or `Cylinder`. Use `Convex Hull` only if necessary. Avoid `Mesh` collisions.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you
http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Fade/Doc:2.6/Manual/3D_interaction/Transform_Control/Reset_Object_Transformations[apply object transformations]
to all collision objects before export.
As a rule of thumb the addon never modifies your objects on its own so you have to do this yourself.
If you don't the collison shapes will most probably be rotated or positioned wrong.

WARNING: Keep in mind SE has an upper limit of 5 collision shapes per block.

NOTE: Blender offers a `Cone` primitive shape but Havok has no support for that.
If you use a Cone shape it will be silently converted to a Convex Hull on export.

==== Mount Points

[.thumb]
image::blender-mp-setup.png[width=450,float=right,link=images/blender-mp-setup.png]

The third layer defines the mount points of your block.
The meshes on this layer are not directly exported but are used instead to calculate the mount point definitions.

This works by creating rectangular faces that use the material `MountPoint` and are aligned to one of
six sides of the block. To quickly create the material and an object that has one mount point face for each
of the six sides use the corresponding button on the Tools panel of the 3D view.
Duplicate, resize and move those faces in edit mode to create more mount points for a side of the block.
You can also split out faces to several objects if you want to apply
link:images/blender-mp-mirror.png[modifiers like 'mirror' or 'array']
to some of the mount point faces.

For mount point editing it is a good idea to switch to link:images/blender-mp-ortho.png[ortho-view] (`Numpad 5`) and
turn on 'snap to grid'. Also, if the mount point layer is visible the addon will show a box with dashed, orange lines.
The lines represents the in-game size of the block as it is defined on the scene tab.
This should help you to position the mount points correctly.

If you don't provide mount points or unmark the layer none will be calculated.
The game defaults to full moint points on all sides of the block in that case.

==== Construction Layers

Lastly there are several layers for the construction phases of the block.
There is one layer for each phase of construction, from earliest to latest.
If you change the number of construction layers you increase or decrease the number of construction phases.
A block is allowed to have no construction phases at all.
If you don't have meshes on a construction layer mwmbuilder will fail to produce a .mwm file for that phase.

The construction phases reuse the same collision shape your main block model uses.
There is currently no way to define seperate collision models for the construction phases
but it would probably be unwise to have those, anyway.
A block model that changes its physical dimensions while the player is welding right next to it can be dangerous.

TIP: A Blender object can be assigned to several layers.
So if your construction models gets more and more detailed you can start with the inital frame as one object that
is visibile on all construction layers and then progressively add more objects towards the final construction layer.

=== Textures

This is a small excursion into how SE textures as block.
SE currently uses a maximum of two textures per face of a mesh.
Both of them have four channels (RGBA).

==== Diffuse/Emissive

By convention Keen names this kind of texture-files with `_de.dds` at the end
but you are allowed to ignore the convention.
The RGB-channels of this texture represent the diffuse color of each pixel of a face --
just like with any regular digital picture.

The A-channel of this texture does not represent the transparency of the pixels, though.
Instead it tells SE how much emissive light a pixel gives off in the dark.
Strangely a value of 0 means full brightness, a value of 255 means no emissivity.
Theoretically the light given off could be different from the diffuse color of the pixel but in SE
it is always the same as the diffuse color so there are no extrA-channels for that.

NOTE: The emissivity channel is only considered if the material (see next section) that uses the texture is
named `Emissive`.

===== Recolorable Blocks

If the texture-filename ends in `_me.dds` instead the A-channel serves a double purpose.
Here the values in the range 115 to 140 serve as a mask -- so you can't have Emissivity at these levels.
The mask tells the game how much of the color the user has chosen for the block it should mix in.
A value of 140 means "only the user's color", a value of 115 means "only the block's color".

==== Normal/Specular

This kind of texture is named with `_ns.dds` at the end and contains no color information at all.
The RGB-channels contain a standard DirectX normal-map.
The A-channel tells the game how much of a materials maximum specularity settings it should apply to a pixel.
A value of 0 means "don't apply any specularity", a value of 255 means "apply full specularity".

TIP: The A-channel normally controls transparency in tools like Gimp or Photoshop so it can be hard
to edit SE's textures. It's therefor a good idea to seperate the channels in those tools.
For example, in Gimp you can convert the A-channel into a layer mask and edit and view that separately.

=== Materials

==== Texturing

[.thumb]
image::blender-material-simple.png[width=450,float=right,link=images/blender-material-simple.png]

Materials are what you use to tell SE which texture-files to use for the faces of your meshes (and you use
http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Textures/Mapping/UV/Unwrapping[UV-mapping]
to tell the game which _part_ of a texture to use for a face).

In Blender there are several types of materials depending on the renderer you have chosen.
If you choose `Blender Render` as the renderer you can switch between simple and node-based materials.
If you choose `Cycles` as the renderer you are forced to use node-based materials.

This addon needs you to use simple materials because these are the only ones where it can reliably know
it can find the texture-files in the slots on the Texture property tab.

It distinguishes between the diffuse/emissive and the normal/specular textures by looking at the influence levels
of the textures. If the 'Diffuse' influence is above 0.0 the texture is considered to be the diffuse/emissive texture.
If the 'Normal' influence level is above 0.0 it is considered to be the normal/specular texture.

TIP: If you configure no normal/specular texture and your diffuse/emissive texture's filename uses Keen's convention
to end in `_de.dds` or `_me.dds` the addon assumes there is a normal/specular texture-file that ends with `_ns.dds`
and will export that to SE automatically. So following the convention saves you some work if you are not interested
in viewing the normal map or specularity in Blender.

===== Texture Paths

The game resolves texture-paths relative to two different base folders.
The first is the game's `Content/` folder (so you are able to reuse the game's textures),
the second is the root-folder of the mod. This is why the addon expects the .blend file to be in the root-folder
because it then automatically knows the location of that folder without you telling it.

When exporting .mwm files the addon derives the correct relative texture-paths by comparing each texture's absolute path
against the root-folder of your mod and addionally to the game's location (as configured in the addon preferences).

IMPORTANT: Don't use texture-files that are not inside the mod folder.
Neither Blender nor the addon will prevent you from doing so but this will not work when exporting .mwm files.

NOTE: The addon does not check if the path of a texture actually points to an exisiting file.
But it's easy to spot missing texture-files when you configure the 3D view to display meshes with their materials.

==== Specularity

Specularity is configured per material. You do that in the "Space Engineers" panel of the material.
The values you set there are the maximum values for that material.
How much of those maximum values are actually applied to the pixel of a face
is determined by the A-channel of the normal/specular texture.

WARNING: There is also a "Specular" panel. This is the wrong panel.
With that you control specularity as it is rendered by Blender.
The algorithm Blender uses is similiar to the one SE uses but the values have different meanings.
So the addon cannot reuse Blender's settings and you have to provide them separately for SE.

The effect of the two values `Intensity` and `Power` are hard to describe so it is best if you play with them
and watch the results in-game. Just know that at high values (30.0 / 30.0) the game's specularity shader
also starts to mirror the environment like smooth metal would do.

==== Glass materials

Glass materials have some extra settings that are not contained in an .mwm file
but are instead stored in a file called `TransparentMaterials.sbc`.
It makes no sense for this addon to support editing the content of this file
because the settings cannot be viewed in Blender, anyway.

What you get if you change a material from `Normal` to `Glass` are the settings that _are_ stored in the
.mwm file on export. For the meaning of these settings please refer to Keen's
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=300427203&searchtext=transparent[tutorial]
on transparent materials.

==== Special Material Names

Normally you are free to choose the name of a material.
But there are some visuals in SE that are only enabled if the material of the face has a special name

===== Emissivity

Emissivity is generally only enabled if the material is named `Emissive`.
Otherwise the emissive intensity from the diffuse/emissive texture is ignored.

===== Status lights

A lot of block types have some type of status indicator.
Landing Gear displays the lock state,
several other blocks show if they are powered,
conveyors show if the conveyor-line is etablished or broken, etc.

Because all these are some form of lights Keen chose to also use the `Emissive` material name for this.
If a block has more than one status the materials are addionaly numbered, starting with zero
(so `Emissive0` through `Emissive3` for batteries, for example).

NOTE: For status-lights you have basically no control over the color of the face.
The game uses hard-coded values to override the color with the typical black, yellow, green or red.

TIP: It's easy to spell "Emissive" wrong. If status lights don't work the first thing you should check is
if you named the material "Emmisive".

=== Empties

SE uses empties to represent predefined points of interest on a model like terminal keypads, cargo ports or
the location of the thruster flame. The empty's function is determined by its name.

TIP: For those empties that are used as a 'yellow interaction box' in-game it is beneficial to set the
`Display` property to `Cube` and the `Size` property to 0.5. This way you can preview the exact size in Blender.

There are some empty types that require linking to other model files that contain attached parts.
Currently these are doors, rotors and pistons.
For those there is the `file` property on the data tab for empties.
