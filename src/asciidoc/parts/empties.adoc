=== Empties

==== Location Markers

SE uses empties to represent predefined points of interest on a model like terminal keypads, cargo ports or
the location of the thruster flame. The purpose of each empty is determined by its name -- i.e. `detector_terminal_1`
 or `detector_conveyor_1` for example.

TIP: For empties that are used as a 'yellow interaction box' in-game it is beneficial to set the
`Display` property to `Cube` and the `Size` property to `0.5`. This way you can preview the exact size in Blender.

===== Linking Model Files

Some blocks like doors, rotors, pistons and turrets are composed of several models each of which is in a separate file.
To link from one of those models to the next SE expects empties that have a name starting with `subpart_`.
For those empties there is the `file` property on the Data tab of the empty that names the next part-file.

==== Mirroring

When SE "mirrors" a block on a mirroring-plane what really happens is that a copy of the block is placed on
the opposite side of the plane at the same distance to the plane as the original block.
Then the copied block is rotated according to the mirroring-settings for the _local block-axis_ that is currently
pointing towards the mirroring-plane. So there is a maximum of three independent mirroring-rotations per block.

You can model these rotations in Blender by adding and rotating three specially named empties to the scene.
By default they are expected to be placed on layer 4.
Fittingly their names have to start with either `MirrorLeftRight`, `MirrorTopBottom` or `MirrorFrontBack`
-- so they can be named `MirrorLeftRight.001` and will still be recognized by the add-on.

Rotations you set on those empties are only valid for export if they are multiples of 90Â°
-- so it's a good idea to turn on snapping when you rotate them in the 3D view.
Even if you adhere to that rule some combinations cannot be used because SE does not support them.
To check if a rotation is valid watch the `Mirroring` property on the Data tab of the empty.

TIP: To get a visual cue if a rotation is the correct one you can create

of your main model and

them to the mirroring-empties.
