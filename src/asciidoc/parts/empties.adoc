=== Empties

==== Location Markers

SE uses empties to represent predefined points of interest on a model like terminal keypads, cargo ports or
the location of the thruster flame. The purpose of each empty is determined by its name -- i.e. `detector_terminal_1`
 or `detector_conveyor_1` for example.

===== Volumetric Handles

Some empties only serve as location markers. Some others like the aforementioned `detector_terminal_1`
have some volume to them and you need to point your crosshair inside the volume to interact with the empty in the game.
The size of that volume is determined by the scaling of the empty.

The add-on needs to know if an empty is a volumetric handle because it needs to scale it down in size
if the option is used to create a small block version from a large block.
To turn an empty into a volumetric handle use the link:images/empty_volumetric_handle.png[corresponding button] {zoom}
This will display the empty as a box with the exact size it will have in-game.

===== Linking Model Files

Some blocks like doors, rotors, pistons and turrets are composed of several models each of which is in a separate file.
To link from one of those models to the next SE expects empties that have a name starting with `subpart_`.
For those empties there is the `file` property on the Data tab of the empty that names the next part-file.

==== Mirroring

When SE "mirrors" a block on a mirroring-plane what really happens is that a copy of the block is placed on
the opposite side of the plane at the same distance to the plane as the original block.
Then the copied block is rotated according to the mirroring-settings for the _local block-axis_ that is currently
pointing towards the mirroring-plane. So there is a maximum of three independent mirroring-rotations per block.

You can model these rotations in Blender by adding and rotating three specially named empties to the scene.
Fittingly their names are `MirrorLeftRight`, `MirrorTopBottom` and `MirrorFrontBack`.
They need to be placed on the layer that is designated as the mirroring layer in the export settings.
By default this is the fourth layer. Use the corresponding button on the Tools panel of the 3D view to quickly do so.
It's okay if Blender adds a .001 suffix to the names, the add-on can handle that.

The rotations you set on the empties are only valid for export if they are multiples of 90Â°
-- so it's a good idea to turn on snapping when you rotate them in the 3D view.
Even if you adhere to that rule some combinations cannot be used because SE does not support them.
To check if a rotation is valid watch the `Mirroring` property on the Data tab of the empty.

NOTE: The objects that are attached to the empties are

of your main model. So modifying them will also change your main model and vice versa.
