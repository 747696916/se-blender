=== DirectX 9 Textures

This is a small excursion into how SE textures a block.
In DirectX 9 rendering mode the game uses two textures per face of a mesh.
Both of them have four channels (RGBA).

==== Diffuse/Emissive

The internal name of this texture is `DiffuseTexture`.
By convention Keen names texture-files of this kind with a suffix of `_de.dds`.
The RGB-channels of this texture represent the diffuse color of a face--just like with any regular digital image.

The A-channel of the texture does not represent the transparency of the pixels, though.
Instead it tells SE how much emissive light a pixel gives off in the dark.
Strangely a value of 0 means full brightness, a value of 255 means no emissivity.
In theory the light given off could be different from the diffuse color of the pixel but in SE
it is always the same as the diffuse color so there are no extra channels for that.

==== Recolorable Blocks

If instead the texture-filename ends in `_me.dds` the A-channel serves a double purpose.
Here the values in the range 115 to 140 represent a mask that controls
which parts of the texture can be recolored by the player.

* A value of 115 means that the pixel is fully recolored with the player-chosen color.
* A value of 140 means that the pixel keeps its original color.
* A value in-between mixes the colors with the corresponding ratio.

Recoloring uses a link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV[HSV color-model]
in which the player-chosen hue replaces the original hue.
Saturation and value are added and clamped at a maximum of 100.

If the value of the texture's A-channel is not in the range 115 to 140 it still controls emissivity
but the values have a slightly different meaning.

* A value of 0 still means the pixel is fully emissive. It also means it is fully recolored.
* A value of 115 means the pixel has no emissivity. Again, it is fully recolored.
* A value of 255 also means the pixel is fully emissive. But here the pixel is not recolored.
* And finally a value of 140 means the pixel is neither emissive nor is it recolored.

==== Normal/Specular

Internally named `NormalTexture` this kind of texture has a suffix of `_ns.dds` and contains no color information at all.
The RGB-channels contain a standard DirectX link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping[normal-map].
The A-channel tells the game how much of a material's maximum specularity settings it should apply to a pixel.
A value of 0 means "don't apply any specularity", a value of 255 means "apply full specularity".

TIP: The A-channel normally controls transparency in tools like Gimp or Photoshop so it can be hard
to edit SE's textures. It's therefor a good idea to separate the channels in those tools.
For example, in Gimp you can convert the A-channel into a layer mask and edit and view that separately.

=== DirectX 11 Textures

In DirectX 11 mode SE employs https://www.allegorithmic.com/pbr-guide[Physically Based Rendering (PBR)]
to render 3D objects. In this mode it uses a different set of three or four textures.

==== PBR textures

The `ColorMetalTexture` (`_cm`) and `NormalGlossTexture` (`_ng`) correspond with the common
link:http://www.marmoset.co/toolbag/learn/pbr-practice#refl[metal/roughness workflow]
where glossiness is just the inverse of roughness. Here the normal map uses the OpenGL convention,
i.e. in comparison to the DirectX convention the green channel is inverted.

==== AO, Emissivity and Recoloring

The `AddMapsTexture` (`_add`) combines additional greyscale maps in its four channels:

* The R-channel contains a baked Ambient Occlusion (AO) map where a value of 255 means 'no occlusion' and 0 means 'fully occluded'.
* The G-channel contains the emissivity. 255 is fully emissive, 0 is non-emissive.
* The B-channel is currently unused and should always be 0.
* The A-channel contains the re-coloring mask. The difference with the DirectX 9 equivalent is that the parts of the
  ColorMetalTexture that are selected by this mask are usually colorless.

==== Transparency

The `AlphamaskTexture` (`_alphamask`) is optionally used to make parts of a texture transparent.
It has a single greyscale channel which really only differentiates between two states:
fully transparent below a value of 128 or fully opaque at 128 or above.
This is most useful for things like foliage and small details like facial hair.
If you want to use this texture you need to also set the technique of the material that uses it to `Alphamask`.

=== Materials

==== Texturing

image::blender-material-v3.png[width=450,float=right,link=images/blender-material-v3.png]

Materials are what you use to tell SE which texture-files to use for the faces of your meshes (and you use
http://www.blender.org/manual/render/blender_render/textures/mapping/uv.html[UV-mapping]
to tell the game which _part_ of a texture to use for a face).

In Blender there are several types of materials depending on the renderer you have chosen.
If you choose Blender Render as the renderer you can switch between simple and node-based materials.
If you choose Cycles as the renderer you can only use node-based materials.

This add-on needs you to use node-based materials because it sets up several nodes to preview the textures in Blender.
It also requires the use of Cycles because the nodes it sets up are meant for this renderer.
So to set a material up for use with SE first switch the scene to use `Cycles Render`
and then use the image:convert-material-button.png[title="Convert to Nodes Material"] button
on the Material property tab. You need to repeat that for each new material you define.

By doing that you get six texture-slots for the different kinds of textures SE expects.
Point them each to the texture-file corresponding with its name.

TIP: You won't be able to see any textures on your meshes until you set your
http://www.blender.org/manual/getting_started/basics/navigating/introduction.html[viewport-shading] to Material.
Setting it to Rendered looks even better but requires a lamp in the scene or everything will be black.

NOTE: In a previous version of the add-on the `Blender Render` and its texture-slots were used.
This setup still works but only for DirectX 9 textures. If your .blend still uses it there is an operator
`Upgrade All Materials to use Nodes` you can use to get to the new material setup.
It's not available on any panel, you need to use Blender's quicksearch (`Space`) to access it.

===== Texture Paths

The game resolves texture-paths relative to two different base folders.
The first is the game's `Content/` folder (so you are able to reuse the game's textures),
the second is the root-folder of the mod. This is why the add-on expects the .blend file to be in the root-folder
because it then automatically knows the location of that folder without you telling it.

When exporting .mwm files the add-on derives the correct relative texture-paths by comparing each texture's absolute path
against the root-folder of your mod and additionally to the game's location (as configured in the add-on preferences).

IMPORTANT: Don't use texture-files that are not inside the mod folder or the game's `Content\` folder.
Neither Blender nor the add-on will prevent you from doing so but this will not work when exporting .mwm files.

NOTE: The add-on does not check if the path of a texture actually points to an existing file.
But it's easy to spot missing texture-files when you configure the 3D view to display meshes with their materials.

==== Specularity

Specularity is a DirectX 9 mode-only setting and is configured per material.
You do that in the "Space Engineers" panel of the material.
The values you set there are the maximum values for that material.
How much of those maximum values are actually applied to a pixel of a face
is determined by the A-channel of the normal/specular texture.

The effect of the two values `Intensity` and `Power` are hard to describe so it is best if you play with them
and watch the results in-game. Just know that at high values (30.0 / 30.0) the game's specularity shader
also starts to mirror the environment like smooth metal would do.

==== Glass Materials

Glass materials are handled specially by the game.
They have some extra settings that are not contained in an .mwm file
but are instead stored in a file called `TransparentMaterials.sbc`.
It makes no sense for this add-on to support editing the content of this file
because the settings cannot be viewed in Blender, anyway.

What you get if you change a material from `Normal` to `Glass` are the settings that _are_ stored in the
.mwm file on export. For the meaning of these settings please refer to Keen's
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=300427203[tutorial]
on transparent materials.

==== Special Material Names

Normally you are free to choose the name of a material.
But there are some visuals in SE that are only enabled if the material of the face has a special name

===== Status lights

A lot of block types have some type of status indicator.
Landing Gear displays the lock state,
several other blocks show if they are powered,
conveyors show if the conveyor-line is established or broken, etc.

Because all these are some form of lights Keen chose to use the material name `Emissive` for this.
If a block has more than one status the materials are additionally numbered, starting with zero
(so `Emissive0` through `Emissive3` for batteries, for example).

NOTE: For status-lights you have basically no control over the color of the face.
The game uses hard-coded values to override the color with the typical black, yellow, red, green or blue.

TIP: It's easy to spell "Emissive" wrong. If status lights don't work the first thing you should check is
if you named the material "Emmisive".
