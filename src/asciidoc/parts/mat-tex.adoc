=== Textures

This is a small excursion into how SE textures a block.
The game currently uses a maximum of two textures per face of a mesh.
Both of them have four channels (RGBA).

==== Diffuse/Emissive

By convention Keen names this kind of texture-file with a suffix of `_de.dds`
but you are allowed to ignore the convention.
The RGB-channels of this texture represent the diffuse color of a face--just like with any regular digital image.

The A-channel of the texture does not represent the transparency of the pixels, though.
Instead it tells SE how much emissive light a pixel gives off in the dark.
Strangely a value of 0 means full brightness, a value of 255 means no emissivity.
In theory the light given off could be different from the diffuse color of the pixel but in SE
it is always the same as the diffuse color so there are no extra channels for that.

==== Recolorable Blocks

If instead the texture-filename ends in `_me.dds` the A-channel serves a double purpose.
Here the values in the range 115 to 140 represent a mask that controls
which parts of the texture can be recolored by the player.

* A value of 115 means that the pixel is fully recolored with the player-chosen color.
* A value of 140 means that the pixel keeps its original color.
* A value in-between mixes the colors with the corresponding ratio.

Recoloring uses a link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV[HSL color-model]
in which the player-chosen hue replaces the original hue.
Saturation and value are added and clamped at a maximum of 100.

If the value of the texture's A-channel is not in the range 115 to 140 it still controls emissivity
but the values have a slightly different meaning.

* A value of 0 still means the pixel is fully emissive. It also means it is fully recolored.
* A value of 115 means the pixel has no emissivity. Again, it is fully recolored.
* A value of 255 also means the pixel is fully emissive. But here the pixel is not recolored.
* And finally a value of 140 means the pixel is neither emissive nor is it recolored.

==== Normal/Specular

This kind of texture has a suffix of `_ns.dds` and contains no color information at all.
The RGB-channels contain a standard DirectX link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping[normal-map].
The A-channel tells the game how much of a material's maximum specularity settings it should apply to a pixel.
A value of 0 means "don't apply any specularity", a value of 255 means "apply full specularity".

TIP: The A-channel normally controls transparency in tools like Gimp or Photoshop so it can be hard
to edit SE's textures. It's therefor a good idea to separate the channels in those tools.
For example, in Gimp you can convert the A-channel into a layer mask and edit and view that separately.

=== Materials

==== Texturing

Materials are what you use to tell SE which texture-files to use for the faces of your meshes (and you use
http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Textures/Mapping/UV/Unwrapping[UV-mapping]
to tell the game which _part_ of a texture to use for a face).

In Blender there are several types of materials depending on the renderer you have chosen.
If you choose `Blender Render` as the renderer you can switch between simple and node-based materials.
If you choose `Cycles` as the renderer you are forced to use node-based materials.

This addon needs you to use simple materials because these are the only ones where it can reliably know
it can find the texture-files in the slots on the Texture property tab.

It distinguishes between the diffuse/emissive and the normal/specular textures by looking at the influence levels
of the textures. If the 'Diffuse' influence is above 0.0 the texture is considered to be the diffuse/emissive texture.
If the 'Normal' influence level is above 0.0 it is considered to be the normal/specular texture.

TIP: If you configure no normal/specular texture and your diffuse/emissive texture's filename uses Keen's convention
to end in `_de.dds` or `_me.dds` the addon assumes there is a normal/specular texture-file that ends with `_ns.dds`
and will export that to SE automatically. So following the convention saves you some work if you are not interested
in viewing the normal map or specularity in Blender.

===== Texture Paths

The game resolves texture-paths relative to two different base folders.
The first is the game's `Content/` folder (so you are able to reuse the game's textures),
the second is the root-folder of the mod. This is why the add-on expects the .blend file to be in the root-folder
because it then automatically knows the location of that folder without you telling it.

When exporting .mwm files the add-on derives the correct relative texture-paths by comparing each texture's absolute path
against the root-folder of your mod and additionally to the game's location (as configured in the add-on preferences).

IMPORTANT: Don't use texture-files that are not inside the mod folder or the game's `Content\` folder.
Neither Blender nor the add-on will prevent you from doing so but this will not work when exporting .mwm files.

NOTE: The add-on does not check if the path of a texture actually points to an existing file.
But it's easy to spot missing texture-files when you configure the 3D view to display meshes with their materials.

==== Specularity

Specularity is configured per material. You do that in the "Space Engineers" panel of the material.
The values you set there are the maximum values for that material.
How much of those maximum values are actually applied to a pixel of a face
is determined by the A-channel of the normal/specular texture.

WARNING: There is also a "Specular" panel. This is the wrong panel.
With that you control specularity as it is rendered by Blender.
The algorithm Blender uses is similar to the one SE uses but the values have different meanings.
Because of that the add-on cannot reuse Blender's settings and you have to provide them separately for SE.

The effect of the two values `Intensity` and `Power` are hard to describe so it is best if you play with them
and watch the results in-game. Just know that at high values (30.0 / 30.0) the game's specularity shader
also starts to mirror the environment like smooth metal would do.

==== Transparent Materials

Transparent materials like glass are handled specially by the game.
They have some extra settings that are not contained in an .mwm file
but are instead stored in a file called `TransparentMaterials.sbc`.
It makes no sense for this add-on to support editing the content of this file
because the settings cannot be viewed in Blender, anyway.

What you get if you change a material from `Normal` to `Glass` are the settings that _are_ stored in the
.mwm file on export. For the meaning of these settings please refer to Keen's
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=300427203[tutorial]
on transparent materials.

==== Special Material Names

Normally you are free to choose the name of a material.
But there are some visuals in SE that are only enabled if the material of the face has a special name

===== Status lights

A lot of block types have some type of status indicator.
Landing Gear displays the lock state,
several other blocks show if they are powered,
conveyors show if the conveyor-line is established or broken, etc.

Because all these are some form of lights Keen chose to use the material name `Emissive` for this.
If a block has more than one status the materials are additionally numbered, starting with zero
(so `Emissive0` through `Emissive3` for batteries, for example).

NOTE: For status-lights you have basically no control over the color of the face.
The game uses hard-coded values to override the color with the typical black, yellow, red, green or blue.

TIP: It's easy to spell "Emissive" wrong. If status lights don't work the first thing you should check is
if you named the material "Emmisive".
