=== Naming Conventions

All names that are used during export are derived from the scene name:

[cols="8,16,1"]
|===
| BlockPairName
| `+++{Name of the Scene}+++`
|

| SubtypeId
| `+++{BlockPairName}_{CubeSize}+++`
| {cstmz}

| ModelsDir
| the chosen export-path from the scene properties
|

| Model
| `+++{ModelsDir}\{SubtypeId}.mwm+++`
| {cstmz}

| Construction Model
| `+++{ModelsDir}\{SubtypeId}_Constr{n}.mwm+++`
| {cstmz}

| Level-of-Detail Model
| `+++{ModelsDir}\{SubtypeId}_LOD{n}.mwm+++`
| {cstmz}

| Icon
| `+++Textures\Icons\{BlockPairName}.dds+++`
|
|===

WARNING: The BlockPairName and the SubtypeId are globally visible to all parts of the game.
So it's important that you choose a sufficiently unique name for the scene to avoid naming-collisions with other mods.
It's probably also a good idea to not use spaces in your names.

You can customize the SubtypeIds of blocks by enabling the corresponding option in the scene properties.
This is primarily meant for mod authors that want to use the add-on but need their existing blocks to keep their ids
to remain backwards-compatible. Otherwise there is hardly a good reason to change them.

=== Configuring the Export

[.thumb]
image::blender-no-nodes-yet.png[float=right]

The addon needs to know which folder models should be exported into.
You can configure this per scene via the `Export Subpath` property in the scene properties.

How the meshes of your scene are exported is configured via a custom Blender node-tree.
Initially your .blend file contains no such node-tree and your scene's default settings-name `MwmExport`
will be displayed as invalid. You can create the default settings by clicking on the `+` next to the settings-selector.

Clicking "Export scene as block" will then immediately export the scene to the chosen folder.
Holding down `Alt` while clicking the button will export all the scenes in your .blend file.
In this case each scene will use its own folder and settings.

WARNING: The chosen export folder needs to be a subpath of the folder containing your .blend file.
Otherwise references to your models will be calculated wrong (CubeBlocks.sbc, LODs).

=== Exporting .mwm files

By default the export runs through theses steps:

 . Export the collision-meshes to a `.hkt.fbx` file
 . Convert the `.hkt.fbx` file into a `.hkt` file via Havok's FBX-importer
 . Run the `.hkt` file through Havok's filter-manager to calculate and add rigid body data to it
 . Repeat the following steps for the main layer and all construction and level-of-detail layers
 .. Export the meshes to a `.fbx` file
 .. Export the info for materials and linked levels-of-detail to a `.xml` file with parameters for MwmBuilder
 .. Use the `.fbx`, `.xml` and `.hkt` files as input for MwmBuilder to produce the final .mwm file

NOTE: The add-on logs the result of each step of the export in Blender's
link:images/blender-report.png[info-log] {zoom}.
In addition the output of external tools is logged to separate log files that are named like the file that is
exported by the step with `.log` appended.
*If an external tool fails for any reason or does not produce the expected file you should consult these log-files*.

=== Block Definitions

When you export .mwm files the add-on also creates a corresponding `.blockdef.xml` file for each exported block.
This file contains all the information that is available in Blender and that is relevant
for a block's `<Definition>` inside your mod's `CubeBlocks.sbc`:

[#blockdef]
```xml
<Definition>
  <Id>
    <SubtypeId>ExampleBlock_Large</SubtypeId>
  </Id>
  <Icon>Textures\Icons\ExampleBlock.dds</Icon>
  <CubeSize>Large</CubeSize>
  <BlockTopology>TriangleMesh</BlockTopology>
  <Size x="1" y="1" z="1"/>
  <ModelOffset x="0" y="0" z="0"/>
  <Model>Models\ExampleBlock_Large.mwm</Model>
  <BuildProgressModels>
    <Model BuildPercentUpperBound="0.33" File="Models\ExampleBlock_Large_Constr1.mwm"/>
    <Model BuildPercentUpperBound="0.67" File="Models\ExampleBlock_Large_Constr2.mwm"/>
    <Model BuildPercentUpperBound="1.00" File="Models\ExampleBlock_Large_Constr3.mwm"/>
  </BuildProgressModels>
  <MountPoints>
    <MountPoint Side="Left" StartX="0.30" StartY="0.00" EndX="1.00" EndY="0.40"/>
    <MountPoint Side="Left" StartX="0.00" StartY="0.00" EndX="0.30" EndY="0.10"/>
    ...
  </MountPoints>
  <MirroringX>HalfY</MirroringX>
  <BlockPairName>ExampleBlock</BlockPairName>
</Definition>
```

IMPORTANT: This definition is incomplete. It only contains the parts Blender knows about.
You have to add missing properties like `<TypeId>` or `<Components>` yourself.

=== Updating CubeBlocks.sbc

You can use the "Update block definitions" operation to tell the add-on to take the same XML data
it writes to a `.blockdef.xml` file and merge it with matching `<Definition>` sections of your mod's `CubeBlocks.sbc`.
That saves you the trouble to do this by hand.

NOTE: Updating `CubeBlocks.sbc` will only work for blocks that are already present in the file.
The add-on searches for them by their `<SubtypeId>`.
