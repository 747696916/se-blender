Modelling blocks for Space Engineers is a process that involves a lot of intermediary files and manual parametrization.
This add-on is a productivity tool that simplifies the steps you need to take to get from a 3D mesh in Blender to
Space Engineerâ€™s own .mwm mesh-format. To do that

. The add-on provides property panels for all the special data SE stores inside an .mwm file directly in Blender.
. You use Blender layers to define the main model, the collision model, mount-points, mirroring-settings,
  level-of-detail models and construction stages.
. The workflow that configures and runs the conversion-tools (Havok, MwmBuilder) for you is customizable
  to suite your needs.

NOTE: The add-on (and this documentation) expect you to know how to work with Blender.
So if you are new to 3D modelling you should probably learn how to do that first before you continue.

// TODO Having said that, there is an addendum that should help you to get on the right track.
