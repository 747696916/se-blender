= SE Block Tools for Blender

Modeling blocks for Space Engineers is a process that involves a lot of intermediary files and manual parametrization.
This addon eases the steps you need to take to get from a 3D mesh in Blender to Space Engineer's own .mwm mesh-format.
To do that it provides property panels for all the special data Space Engineers stores inside an .mwm file
directly in Blender.
In addition it is able to automatically configure and run the conversion-tools you would normally run by hand.

The most current version is available in the

The documentation is published to the project's http://harag-on-steam.github.io/se-blender/[Github pages].
